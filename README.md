# aframe-virtual-interactive-room

This project uses the aframe javascript library to create an interactive room, using many custom *components* and *animations*, and fun and cool things like *mattes*!

There is much documentation in both the `.php` files, as well as `main.js`, so feel free to poke around and learn how it works!

### Disclaimer

A lot of this code was written in a  hurry, the majority had to be finished in less than 48 hours, on a library I had never used, and had to learn on the fly, so wou may find much of the code improvised, WET and maybe not as ideal as I would normally write it. It's still a nice piece of functioning production code!
